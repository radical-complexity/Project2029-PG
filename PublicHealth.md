# Public Health

Alongside the Healthcare system, the United States needs a robust
system for ensuring public health. This can include the food system
(which we treat separately), but it more centrally involves:

- Research into treatments and diseases by public and private entities
- Maintaining readiness to respond to public health challenges
- Ensuring effective communication to the public of any health risks

Two critical parts of this are:

- Funding robust public health research, via the National Institutes of Health and universities
- Ensuring public trust in the communications produced during normal times and in times of public health challenges
