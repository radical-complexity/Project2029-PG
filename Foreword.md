# Foreword: Project 2029
## *A Progressive Vision for America after Trump

>> And, for the support of this Declaration, with a firm
>> reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we
>> mutually pledge to each other our lives, our
>> fortunes, and our sacred honor.

>> There is no path to a better world that does not begin
>> with the firm commitment to respect the dignity of 
>> every human being on the earth.

What we outline here is a vision for what the world could be, and what the
collected contributors to this vision want it to be. Our intention is to push
for this vision, and to elect candidates who support it.
