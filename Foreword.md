## A Progressive Vision for America after Trump

>> And, for the support of this Declaration, with a firm
>> reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we
>> mutually pledge to each other our lives, our
>> fortunes, and our sacred honor.

What we outline here is a vision for what the world could be, and what the
collected contributors to this vision want it to be. Our intention is to push
for this vision, and to elect candidates who support it.

But this comes with a sacred trust: Our system is a representative democracy,
and those who hold office do so on behalf of the people who elected them.
There may be - and almost certainly will be - positions in this document that
are considered outside the mainstream, and for which public support is not yet
solidified (and may never be). This document is *not* a plan for a takeover,
nor a design for imposing this vision on the electorate. While we do not need
unanimity or even full consensus for every action, we pledge to respect that
any authority we are granted by the electorate is only legitimate when we
exercise it on their behalf.

This means that a progressive candidate who is elected from a specific
Congressional district may passionately believe in a range of issues.
This may include  many issues that are supported by the majority of her 
constituents, but it might also include an issue that her district largely
opposes. It is entirely fitting that the representative vote against her
own beliefs. She may continue to advocate for them; she may campaign
on her convictions. But her actions should be guided by her role as a
representative.

There is no firm rule for this; there are times when a representative
must vote her conscience and face the electorate in the next election;
there are times when a representative must do something that she knows
is right and believes the electorate has it wrong. But this document,
while a collection of our best ideas for which we progressives will
fight passionately, is not something that we will force on the American
people. We will always deeply consider the will of the electorate, and
try in every instance to live up to the words of Lincoln: That we are 
a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.
