# Redistricting

Congressional Redistricting is necessary to account for shifts in
demographics, regional residence, and shifting political attitudes.
Set by the Constitution to occur every ten years, and relying on
the decennial census for its basis, redistricting must, first,
account for shifts in population among the states, so that the
number of Congressional representatives allotted to each state
may change as their relative populations change. But within states
redistricting can also reflect shifts in the political attitudes
of the citizens and changes to their geographic locations.

The fundamental assumption that has driven the design of
Congressional distric maps is that each district should have
a single, general election, from which a single representative
is chosen. This underlies several court cases, which have
sought to resolve issues of fairness in both the processes
and outcomes of redistricting. This resolution is needed
because this structure leads to a winner-take-all condition,
and makes it possible for maps to be drawn that have the
effect - intentionally - of causing the result of the
elections to poorly reflect the political views of the
people.

For example, in the simplest case, assume an electorate
divided into two strongly polarized groups (Red and Blue),
and in a particular state one of these groups outnumbers
the other by a margin like 55% (Red) to 45% (Blue). If this state is
to elect one representative, there is little alternative
to a winner-take-all election, and the representative
will likely be Red.

But suppose the state has a population that means it has
20 Representatives. One could imagine an outcome of
11 Red and 9 Blue representatives. Although opinions
may vary, it is easy to make a case that this is more
'fair': both Red and Blue views are represented in
the Congress, roughly in proportion to the numbers
of people in the state holding those views.

Unfortunately, techniques such as 'packing' and 
'cracking' can be used to skew the results. 'Packing'
refers to putting most of the members of one of the
groups into as few districts as possible; 'Cracking'
refers to taking geographic clusters of groups and
splitting them into pieces, placing each piece in
a district where they are now outnumbered by the other
group.

Abstractly, a 55%/45% split in a state with 20 districts
could be drawn so that each district has a majority Red,
and thus the outcome is 20 Red representatives, leaving the
Blue view unrepresented. However, it could also be drawn
so that two or three districts are entirely Red, and the remainder
have a very slight Blue majority, leading to 3 Red and 17 Blue
representatives, which is also misaligned with the population.

These possibilities lead to two important implications.
The first is that 'fair' is difficult to define. It is
possible to suggest that the outcome should reflect, roughly,
the proportions of the electorate's views. This is only one
view, however; it can be argued for or against. But more
significantly, the additional constraints of geography - 
a population that is completely evenly distributed throughout
the state in terms of mixing of views is different from 
a state in which all those holding Blue views live in
one part of the state, or in several clusters - as well as
constraints on the process (who draws maps, who evaluates and
approves them) can all lead to different claims to 'fairness'.
There have been attempts to impose both fair processes - e.g.,
allowing representatives of both Red and Blue groups to participate
in drawing the maps, and legislative requirements about the
qualities of the resulting districts (compactness, continuity, 
etc.), but it remains contested.

The second, which falls from the first, is that the arena 
in which the districts are contested has become an arena of
power rather one of service. Rather than working toward a condition
in which the views of the people are most efficiently translated
into the election of like-minded representatives, it is instead
a contest in which each group tries to draw the boundaries
that are most favorable to its preferred outcomes. Because
of the central importance of the makeup of districts to
the operation of the government, including future elections,
this becomes a way to consolidate and lock-in power.

Project 2029 fosters creative ways to achieve a government
that better serves the people. Consequently, we entertain
a collection of varying proposals to revise the Congressional
redistricting process.
