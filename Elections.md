# Project 2029: Elections #

The previous ten years have been marked by repeated claims of election fraud.
These have been voiced loudly, have taken a number of forms, and have dominated
much of our discourse for certain specific periods. Among the forms of these
claims are the claims that non-citizens are voting, the claims that ballots
are being falsified, the claims that electronic voting machines are converting
votes, and claims that election laws unfairly favor Democrats.

These claims have never been borne by evidence. Moreover, they generally
exist against a reality in which much of the opposite is true: those claiming
the vote is unfair against them (who, incidentally, rarely raise the same claims
in elections where they have won) are simultaneously involved in a series of
activities to restrict the vote in ways that guarantee their own future victories.

With this in mind, a Progressive series of actions in 2027 and 2029 will:

- Pass a new version of the Voting Rights Act
- Ensure that electoral boards do not improperly claim the authority to refuse to certify votes


## Democratic Primaries

The Presidential Election of 2024 was catastrophic for the Democratic Party because
it initially declined to have a meaningful primary. Instead, Democrats were expected
to support President Biden's re-election bid, despite legitimate concerns about his
ability to win the election as well as his fitness for office for four additional years.
The primary was conducted, but he ran without any legitimate opposition, and no
primary debates or other opportunities for Democratic voters to judge him in a contested
setting. This later proved disastrous when he failed to make a legitimate showing in the
debate against his opponent in the general election, causing him to withdraw his candidacy,
and requiring the Democrats to pivot to supporting a candidate who was selected by
acclamation within the party, but without a genuine primary.

However, the primary process also includes numerous flaws. Previous elections began with
a primary in New Hampshire and Iowa caucuses. The competition to be the first primary
pushed some of these back into December, a full 10 months before the general election.
There was also an attempt to move the South Carolina primary earlier, and possibly even
first, because it was believed to represent the demographics of the general election
and the outcome of the electoral college better.

It has long been recognized that the entire primary system is open to criticism because
states that have early primaries get more attention than those that have late primaries;
and of course, the entire process is shaped by the Electoral College. The result is that
some states' citizens have no opportunity to interact with some of the candidates, and
their votes are ultimately considered less valuable.
