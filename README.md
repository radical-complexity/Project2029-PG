# Project2029
A Progressive Agenda and Vision for Our Country

The files in this directory are eventually assembled into the final pdf;
The order is:

- Foreword
- Elections
- EducationAndUniversities
- Healthcare
- Foreign_Policy
- BudgetAndDeficit
- MediaAndPress
- Trade

To write, use a text editor (not MS-Word or other word processing software).
Follow the guidelines [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
They're very simple; for example the list above was created by using simple dashes:

```
- Foreword
- Elections
- EducationAndUniversities
- Healthcare
- Foreign_Policy
- BudgetAndDeficit
- MediaAndPress
- Trade
```
