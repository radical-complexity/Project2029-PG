# Project2029
A Progressive Agenda and Vision for Our Country

The files in this directory are eventually assembled into the final pdf;
The order is:

- Foreword
- Elections
- EducationAndUniversities
- Healthcare
- Foreign_Policy
- BudgetAndDeficit
- MediaAndPress
- Trade

To write, use a text editor (not MS-Word or other word processing software).
Follow the guidelines [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
They're very simple; for example the list above was created by using simple dashes:

```
- Foreword
- Elections
- EducationAndUniversities
- Healthcare
- Foreign_Policy
- BudgetAndDeficit
- MediaAndPress
- Trade
```
## Who can make changes?
Github allows people to:

- Check out the current version of a document
- Create a branch of the current version
- Modify the document in the new branch (which leaves the original unaffected)
- Request that the changes found in the new branch be merged into the original

After this, the document owners can select with pieces to merge into the main branch of the code.

The exact process for how we determine what changes go into the final version is TBD.

One note: There is a 'main' branch and a 'working_draft' branch. Do not touch the
'main' branch. The 'main' branch is used to establish points where a version
is considered 'finished' and released; the 'working_draft' branch is the place
where things are considered to be work-in-progress.

## How is the PDF generated?

The document managers have a way to take the individual topic files and merge
them into a final PDF document. They do this each time there is a new change
(or collection of changes) merged back into the main branch.
