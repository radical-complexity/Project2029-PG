## Timing and Procedures for Passing a Budge

Passing a budget is one of the core roles for
Congress. The Constitution stipulates that all
bills related to spending must originate in the
House of Representatives. This is blurred by the
practical reality that the Executive, which has
veto power, tends to set budgetary priorities, so
that the media often refers to the `President's
Budget'. The fact is that Congress, not the
President, is both responsible for and in control
of all spending by the U.S government.

In a process that has played out over decades,
the construction and approval over a budget has
become at once Byzantine, comical, and tragic.
It is Byzantine because it is buried in layers
of rules (e.g. Reconciliation bills and Continuing
Resolutions); it is comical because it is laughably
complex and yet astonishingly predictable. And it
is tragic because it has become an emblem of
dysfunctionality: government shutdowns, late-night
bargaining, late Friday evening announcements, 
scribbled amendments that no one has time to review, and
a host of other things that are clearly not in
the interest of either the nation or the American
public.

One clear sign of this is the fact that budget
discussions are now nearly constant. In the past, a budget
would be passed for the new Fiscal Year (beginning
October 1st), and would remain in effect for that
year. Now we live in a world where it can be a
political victory to delay a government shutdown by
a few weeks, pushing the budget negotiations a month
down the road but leaving the country teetering
repeatedly on the edge of a precipice.

An additional point that plays into this is the
debt ceiling, which is dealt with in similar ways.

This should stop. However, stopping it will require
political imagination: what must be found is a way
to hold the House, Senate, and Executive accountable
for passing a budget in a timely way (and, thereafter,
returning to the other business of the country). The
difficulty is that the mechanisms for accountability
are limited to Impeachment, Recall, or being defeated
in an election. These have been available and have
not led to a solution.
