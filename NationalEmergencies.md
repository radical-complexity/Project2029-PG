# National Emergencies

Congress has enacted legislation that allows the executive to have special authority and power in times of national emergencies. This is an appropriate means to allow the executive to react to rapidly changing situations and make fine-scale decisions in a way for which the deliberative, legislative body is not well-equipped.

A component of this is that the executive is able to declare that the state of national emergency exists. This opens an immediate opportunity for an executive to obtain additional power by declaring that an emergency exists (even if one does not), and then asserting the extended power.

The check on this is necessarily retroactive: Once declared, periods of national emergency can be reviewed by Congress, can be extended, or can expire after a set period of time.

This general structure is not without merit. However, over the past three decades, Presidents have made extensive use of these declarations. Some national emergencies belie the basic definition, and have been used to address issues that are on long time scales and reflect slow processes.

The dynamics in play with respect to the powers of the branches of government are complex: Congress may prefer that the executive address these matters, and so may elect to permit the state of emergency to continue or even renew it for long periods while the executive takes certain steps that are permitted under the extended authority. One effect of this is that the authority, and power, that is accorded to the executive, begins to become entrenched and normalized. Another is that Congress can perpetually abdicate its role in designing policy, and instead avoid any action, concealing its failure to perform its duty in a passivity that may simply be unnoticed by the public.

The most recent example of this, the 'Economic National Emergency' declared by the sitting executive, is a case in point, and carries the dynamic to a disturbing extent. According to the original rule, Congress can reassert its authority at any time, using a mechanism by which any member can call a vote to reconsider whether the state of emergency exists. The specifics of the legislation require that, once called, the vote must occur within 15 days. The current Congress has implemented legislation to redefine a 'day'; effectively they are not only avoiding the vote, but denying their members the opportunity to exert the Congressional control that the original legislation offered.

Beginning as soon as possible, this arrangement must be reconsidered, so that the executive can exert its authority only in more limited ways, and Congress will be (again) required to act in its Article I role and enact policy that guides and constrains the executive as it responds to a time-limited emergency.

Goal: Limiting the extended authority of the president via declarations of national emergencies.

Proposal: Once declared, a national emergency grants the executive extended powers for no more than 15 days. After that point, any action undertaken under these extended powers must be authorized by Congress explicitly.
