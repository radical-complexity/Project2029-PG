## Congressional Power

Over time, and influenced by the theory of the Unitary Executive, Congress
has ceded its power to the President. This may not, in itself, be a bad
thing: The President is elected and answerable to the public, and it is
fitting that Congress delegate some of its power to the executive and
defer in some cases to executive authority. But the balance of powers
was established to ensure that power was not unduly concentrated in
one branch, and, more threateningly, in one person. As Congress has
become less effective, more power has been gathered by (and given to)
the President. This should be redressed.

### Impeachment

#### Notes:

- Paulsen [@Paulsen_Presidents_2017] argues that Congress's impeachment power is absolute;
while the language of the Constitution treats all impeachments as akin to trials (via
terms such as 'convict' and the use of the phrase 'High Crimes and Misdemeanors'),
it structurally permits Congress to determine how this should be interpreted, with the
result that the only procedural constraint on impeachment is the numerical requirements
of 50% in the House and 2/3 in the Senate. This allows Congress to be deliberate and act
like a jury trial (for, say, removal of a Circuit Judge accused of drunkenness) but would
also allow speed in removing a dangerous executive (as could, in theory, have happened in
the hours after the January 6th insurrection).


### National Emergencies

#### Notes:

- The Brennan Center for Justice maintains a list [@BrennanCenterforJustice_Guide_2025] of the powers given to the President in national emergencies of different kinds.
- The Brennan Center for Justice also maintains a list [@BrennanCenterforJustice_Declared_2025] of all national emergencies declared (89) and those currently/still in efffect today (51).
- In early 2025 House Republicans declared that the rest of the first year of the 119th Congress would not count as calendar days to avoid Democrats forcing a vote[@Brooks_House_2025].
