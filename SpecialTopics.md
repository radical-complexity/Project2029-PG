### Impeachment

The impeachment process outlined by the Constitution can be interpreted
narrowly or broadly; in practice it has been interpreted narrowly. We
advocate for a broader interpretation that differentiates between two
cases: an evidentiary case and a political case.

The evidentiary case resembles the process as it exists now. It is
most easily envisioned as a case against a lower court justice accused
of some violation of a clear criminal statute. In this case, the process
of impeachment by the House and Conviction by the Senate resembles the
process of indictment and trial [CITE CASTEN BLOG].

The political case is different, and is most easily envisioned as a
case against a high officer (including the President) and, importantly,
in which there is no genuine dispute about the facts of the case.

In the former, the role of the House is to take the evidence that it
has been informed of or discovered through its own powers of subpoena,
determine that there is a a likelihood that the action of which the
defendant is accused occurred, and pass along the recommendation to the
Senate that it hold a trial to determine whether the evidence is sufficient
to warrant the removal of the officeholder.

In the second, a critical difference is that the issue at hand is not
evidence; there is (in this hypothetical) no dispute about whether the
conduct occurred. The question being resolved via the impeachment 
process is whether, given this conduct, it is in the best interests of 
the United States for the person to be removed from office.

Extensive discussions have occurred about the breadth of the impeachment
power; our view is that they conflate these two cases. Congress has the
power to exercise impeachment in either of these two ways.

There are only two checks on Congress's impeachment power: the first is
that impeachment requires a simple majority in the House and a 2/3
majority in the Senate; and the second is that any member of Congress
involved in an impeachment proceding can be held accountable by voters
in their next election if they seek office again.

Our view is that this remains true even though the Constitution refers to
the Senate proceding as a trial and instructs that it be overseen by
the Chief Justice if the defendant is a President. In the evidentiary
case, many of the trappings of a criminal trial are appropriate, and the
role of Senators can be usefully considered to be one of finding fact:
did the conduct occur. The political case, however, is quite different.

The founders discussed the impeachment process at length [CITE SOME EXAMPLES], and
were explicit in their ancillary writings that the impeachment power
was not merely a 'vote of no confidence' in the executive. But despite
these expressed concerns, the best resolution they could establish was
a process that relied on numbers in the House and the Senate.

[It is worth remembering here that the Senate was quite different in the
original Constitution: Senators were determined by state legislatures, and
thus were not subject to the same political forces as are Senators today.
Thus the framers likely envisioned a different kind of proceding than
we see today. It is possible to argue that the original version might have
been more impartial; it is also possible to argue that the current version
better allows the will of the people to be reflected in the process. Our
framing that there are two different kinds of procedings highlights the
difference between these roles.]

The founders additionally enabled the impeachment process to move forward
based on `high crimes and misdemeanors', which was another deliberate choice:
no violation of a criminal statute is needed. This is not only appropriate
but necessary: It would be impossible to write statutes that could encompass
all of the ways that officeholders, especially in the executive, could violate
the law. The founders, recognizing this, allowed Congress to recognize behavior
and define it to be impeachable ex post facto, rather than, as must be done
for most criminal conduct, outlawing it in advance and punishing the violations
that can (obviously) occur only after the law is enacted.

Another important distinction should be mentioned: It has been stated
that the Constitution contains an 'implicit' invocation of due process 
[cite CASTEN]. This is true, and reflects the evidentiary case. But differences
exist. One notable difference is that due process is required by the
Constitution in cases that involve depriving an individual of "life, liberty,
or property." However, impeachment involves only removal from office. The
defendant will not be deprived of life (even treason would be tried in court);
nor would they be imprisoned (also possibly if a criminal statute were violated);
nor will the impeachment process deprive the defendant of property. This last
part is emphatic: the office is not the defendant's property.

The conclusion from this is that the 'due process' required (implicitly) by
the impeachment clause is distinct from that of criminal procedings in court.
Our contention is that for an 'evidentiary' impeachment. much of the process
can and should resemble a criminal proceding, but for the political case
it needn't.

Much of this discussion is driven by the need to justify the removal of a
high office holder, and the proper difficulty of reaching the bar for
removal. But there is also a reverse case: In the event of clear misconduct,
what is the bar for keeping an official in place? Put another way, can 34
Senators keep a criminal in office merely by ignoring evidence of criminal
conduct and voting 'no' on any attempt to impeach? The answer, perhaps
unfortunately, is yes. Again, the check on this at the ballot box, and
is ultimately political, even in cases where the evidentiary process is used.

But if this is an unfortunate outcome, so is the opposite: unwarranted removal.
Suppose that the House and the Senate vote to impeach and 'convict' a President
shortly after inauguration (perhaps even on the same day). This might reflect
a disdain for the will of the people who elected the president and a usurpation
of their role. In a bizarre version, the House elects its Speaker, and then
Congress impeaches both the President and Vice President, essentially installing
the Speaker of the House as the President.

This would seem to flout all of the principles of democracy. It technically doesn't:
for example, suppose between election in November and inauguration in January,
facts came to light about the character and conduct of the president elect that
made the whole country experience 'buyer's remorse'; the Congress could simply
be expressing the will of the people to correct a mistake. The fact that this
example exists shows that the process is fundamentally political.

Nevertheless, it seems open to abuse. We have allowed retroactive impeachments
to occur - that is, after the officeholder has left office. Suppose someone
declares his candidacy for President who happens to have held an office before -
for example, Pete Buttigieg, who was Transportation Secretary, declares his 
intention to run for President in 2028. Suppose a nefarious Congress waits
until two days before the election, then impeaches him and convicts him
retroactively for, say, his handling of the East Palestine, OH, train
derailment, throwing the election into chaos because one of the major party
candidates is now ineligible for the office.

Or, worse, suppose it becomes routine for a Congress to simply impeach
all previous officeholders of the opposing party.

What prevents this? Custom, practice, and the (very flexible) procedures in
the Senate might slow this or even stop it, but they needn't. Politically, the
desire for re-election is the single formal check. But Constitutionally? Nothing.

We do not advocate the abuse of the impeachment power, and we recognize
that it is intended as a limited redress against genuine violations of either
criminal statute or the public trust.

However, we make two important notes:

The first is that the imposition of 'due process' is warranted only to a degree;
and the continued imposition of more and more requirements under the heading of
'due process' serves only to favor the defendants and limit the prosecution - 
exactly the (beneficial) outcome in civilian criminal proceedings, but can be
inappropriate in the political impeachment.

The reason for this is that difference between the purposes of impeachment and the
role it plays in our governance vs. the role of trial and conviction in civilian
criminal proceedings. In civilian criminal proceedings, the balance is intentionally
swung toward the defendant; this is because our society is better if the government
is limited in its ability to deprive citizens of life, liberty, and property, and
because the costs of failing to convict a guilty defendant are generally small
when compared to the societal cost of losing this balance. The role of the criminal
trial is to enforce laws, punish transgressors, and maintain order on a localized
scale.

The purpose of impeachment, however, is to maintain the integrity of the government.
It is, in fact, not about the defendant at all: it is about the office he or she
holds. Congress is allowed to consider all of this cost when it makes decisions
about impeachment; we argue that it is obligated to do so.

This leads to the second note, which is the most concrete policy recommendation about
impeachment that we hold. The finding by the Supreme Court that the president enjoys
immunity from prosecution for his official acts unless he is first impeached for
those acts is fundamentally flawed. While the purpose of an 'evidentiary' impeachment
resembles a criminal trial, it never fully escapes from being a 'political' impeachment -
nor should it. The intent of the impeachment process, however, much it genuinely
desires to be fair and impartial in the evidentiary sense, is ultimately the protection
of the office. It therefore should not be implicated in subsequent criminal prosecution
of the officeholder.

For example, suppose an officeholder is found to have committed multiple acts that
Congress deems impeachable. These need not be criminal: an argument, to which we
are sympathetic, can be made that even something like the pardon power, which is
explicitly the absolute prerogative of the President, can be basis for an impeachment
(for example pardoning the January 6th insurrectionists, or issuing pardons for
political donors and supporters).

Suppose that Congress selects one of these acts, impeaches, convicts, and removes the
officeholder. Our contention is that at this point, Congress has met its obligation
and served its role, fulfilling its responsibility to the country by protecting the
office.

This should not preclude criminal prosecution for the *other* offenses that the
individual may have committed. Arguably Congress must act as quickly as possible
against a threat to the integrity of the office, so selecting the most easily
achievable prosecution is not only expedient but requisite. But having completed
the removal, Congress should not then be expected to prosecute every other possible
criminal act. Having seen that the impeachment process is not the same as an
evidentiary one, it seems reasonable that there should not be a requirement that
the impeachment - subject as it is to political pressure - should be a first step
to prosecution of criminality. It is better if the courts, which are configured to
be impartial and evidentiary, do this. And neither should an impeachment be a precondition
for criminal prosecution.

Congress's role is to protect the integrity of the office and the interests of the
United States. To equate this with criminal prosecution is a conflation. To make
subsequent prosecution dependent on impeachment is improper. We contend that the decision
in [Court Case here] should be overturned.
