\chapter{Day 1 Repairs}
A number of the changes that have been made by the current administration can be repaired as simply as they were wrought: via executive order, ideally executed on Day 1. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Restore the name of the Gulf of Mexico
\item Restore the name of Denali
\end{itemize}
